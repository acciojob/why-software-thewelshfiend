    <h1>Why I want to become a developer?</h1>
    <p>A few months back I had to work on a website as part of a university project, and that was the first time I had delved into web development. Though I was only responsible for the basic Front-end, utilizing HTML, CSS & Bootstrap, it was a novel experience... creating something and watching it take form as a website or webpage. It gave me a different feeling as compared to regular DSA coding which I was used to. Hence, the reason I have chosen to completely step into the Developer path.</p>
